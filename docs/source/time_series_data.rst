One interesting run is to watch a sample undergo some transformation, such as a
phase transition. Since GeRM provides energy resolved measurements, this can
lead to a 3D data set of (q space, energy, time).

The data is acquired by simply starting the GeRM detector and having it write
ot a binary blob.

The data can be read back in by the following function:

.. code-block: python
